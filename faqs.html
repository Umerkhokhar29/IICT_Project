Straightforward and simple, but still memorable and ingenious — based on his words, that could well have been the instructions given to the designers nearly 90 years ago. That’s when, in 1932, the four companies Audi, DKW, Horch and Wanderer joined together to form Auto Union AG, which would later become AUDI AG. And the company needed a new logo. The four interlocking rings were born.</span>
